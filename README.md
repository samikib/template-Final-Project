# CS 100 Programming Project

Project Name: Legend of the Four Heroes
Group Members: Karina Lee (klee220@ucr.edu), Samiha Kibria (skibr001@ucr.edu), Micheal Risher (mrish001@ucr.edu)

App:: A RPG style game in the vein of games like old Final Fantasy games.

The development will focus on the development on the gameplay mechanics and the implementation of design patterns. If time permits then a story and other mechanics will be implemented. The hope is to gain experience in the development of a game and create a project that can be used in portfolios as our group members are looking at internships and graduation.

Tools: The plan is to use an engine, either Gamemaker of Unreal Engine as both use C++ scripts. Our plan is to use Unreal Engine as it is actually used in industry, however, since Gamemaker is a little easier to use, so we may Gamemaker.

I/O: Input will be the keyboard keys: a, s, f, d and the directional keys. Outputs: a will accept, b will cancel, f and d will be menu keys, and the directional keys will provide movement.
